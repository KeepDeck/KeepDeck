/**
 * Experimental features ([F6] → Experimental) — opt-in capabilities that ship
 * behind a setting because they aren't done. Each row mirrors the General
 * section's toggle pattern (label + On/Off + hint) so the sizing, spacing and
 * typography match every other section, and each choice persists across
 * restarts like every other setting.
 *
 * The two toggles gate differently — the hints say so, this is why: Remote
 * agents gates the CREATION surface (the "+ Agent" dialog) only, so turning
 * it off hides the option going forward while existing remote panes keep
 * their endpoint until closed. MCP server is a LIVE switch in both
 * directions: On brings the deck's command socket up, Off tears it down and
 * disconnects its clients.
