/**
 * A tiny registry mapping a pane id to the two ways text can reach its live
 * PTY session:
 *
 *  - `write` — RAW bytes straight into the PTY, in the vein of keyboard
 *    `onData`. Reached via `writeRawToPane` (the name flags it as the niche
 *    raw path). Used by file drag-and-drop, which shapes its own paste
 *    framing around image paths and must not be re-framed.
 *  - `paste` — framed paste, routed by the registrant through whatever the
 *    pane's renderer does for a hand paste. Used by programmatic TEXT
 *    insertion (voice dictation, spawn task delivery) so the text reaches the
 *    agent the same way a hand paste would; the renderer (not this registry)
 *    decides the framing.
 *
 * One entry per pane: a single `registerPaneInput` call registers both
 * together, so `paneInputReady` (which gates the one entry) is a faithful
 * readiness signal for whichever channel a caller writes through — there is no
 * "the ready channel is not the delivery channel" gap. Each `TerminalPane`
 * registers on mount and removes on unmount. Pane ids are unique across the
 * whole app (one global counter), so there are no collisions.
